# Final-Project-SoftAcademy
This project was developed primarily using HTML and CSS, with minor implementations of Bootstrap and jQuery. It was created as the final project for my course at SoftAcademy, which focused on building foundational web development skills with an emphasis on HTML and CSS.

To run the project, simply open index.html using Live Server.
